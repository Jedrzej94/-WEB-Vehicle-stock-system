# (WEB) Vehicle stock system
___________________________________
This is more advanced system that I had to develop as my assignment back in UK when I have lived there. It is a WEB vehicle system, which is including:

- Databases (accounts, vehicles).
- User login system, sign in & sign up using database (with password hashing).
- Basic maintain functions such as: add, amend, delete, view etc.
- Different permissions depending on the admin (user's) level.

# Database
